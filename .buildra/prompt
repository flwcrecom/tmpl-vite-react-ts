CRITICAL Vite + React WebContainer Rules:
- package.json MUST have "type": "module"
- vite.config.ts uses ESM imports
- index.html MUST exist at project root with <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx">
- ALWAYS use `npm run dev` to start — never use bare `vite`
- React uses JSX transform (react-jsx) — no need to import React in every file
