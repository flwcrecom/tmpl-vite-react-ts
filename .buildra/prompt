This is a React + Vite + TypeScript project with shadcn/ui (full component library) pre-configured and ready to use.

AVAILABLE UI COMPONENTS (import from @/components/ui/):
accordion, alert-dialog, avatar, badge, button, card, checkbox, dialog, dropdown-menu,
input, label, popover, progress, radio-group, scroll-area, select, separator, sheet,
skeleton, slider, sonner (toaster), switch, tabs, textarea, toast, toggle, tooltip

AVAILABLE LIBRARIES:
- lucide-react: Icons (e.g., import { Plus, Trash2, Check } from "lucide-react")
- react-router-dom: Client-side routing
- react-hook-form + zod + @hookform/resolvers: Form validation
- @tanstack/react-query: Data fetching and caching
- recharts: Charts and data visualization
- sonner: Toast notifications (toast("Success!"))
- date-fns: Date formatting and manipulation
- framer-motion is NOT included but can be installed if needed

STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all custom styling
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI elements — do NOT build from scratch what shadcn provides
- The cn() helper is at @/lib/utils for merging Tailwind classes
- CSS variables define the theme (--primary, --secondary, --background, etc.)
- Dark mode is supported via the "class" strategy

PATTERNS:
- Import components: import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
- Path alias: @/ maps to src/
- Use sonner for toasts: import { toast } from "sonner"; toast("Done!")
- For forms: use react-hook-form with zodResolver

COMMANDS — you have full shell access and MUST use it:
- Run `npm install && npm run dev` to install and start the dev server
- You CAN and SHOULD run any shell commands needed
- NEVER use `vite` directly — always use `npm run dev`
- To add more shadcn components: npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
