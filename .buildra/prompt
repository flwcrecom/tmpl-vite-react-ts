This is a React + Vite + TypeScript project with shadcn/ui (full component library) pre-configured and ready to use.

DESIGN SYSTEM WORKFLOW (follow this order):
1. Think about what the user wants and what design fits it — colors, mood, personality
2. Update CSS variables in src/index.css with HSL values that match the project:
   - --primary, --secondary, --accent for brand colors
   - --background, --foreground for base theme
   - Add custom tokens: --gradient-primary, --shadow-elegant, etc.
3. Optionally update tailwind.config.cjs for custom animations, gradients, or shadows
4. Create shadcn component variants if needed (e.g., premium button, hero card)
5. THEN build components using semantic tokens — NEVER raw colors

SEMANTIC TOKENS — MANDATORY:
- NEVER use: text-white, bg-white, bg-blue-500, text-gray-700, bg-black, etc.
- ALWAYS use: text-primary, bg-background, text-foreground, text-muted-foreground, bg-card, bg-accent, border-border
- Define all custom styles in index.css and tailwind.config.cjs — NOT inline in components
- Example custom tokens:
  --gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(var(--primary)), hsl(var(--primary) / 0.8));
  --shadow-elegant: 0 10px 30px -10px hsl(var(--primary) / 0.3);

AVAILABLE UI COMPONENTS (import from @/components/ui/):
accordion, alert-dialog, avatar, badge, button, card, checkbox, dialog, dropdown-menu,
input, label, popover, progress, radio-group, scroll-area, select, separator, sheet,
skeleton, slider, sonner (toaster), switch, tabs, textarea, toast, toggle, tooltip

AVAILABLE LIBRARIES:
- lucide-react: Icons (e.g., import { Plus, Trash2, Check, ListTodo } from "lucide-react")
- react-router-dom: Client-side routing
- react-hook-form + zod + @hookform/resolvers: Form validation
- @tanstack/react-query: Data fetching and caching
- recharts: Charts and data visualization
- sonner: Toast notifications (toast("Success!"))
- date-fns: Date formatting and manipulation
- framer-motion is NOT included but can be installed if needed

COMPONENT PATTERNS:
- Import components: import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
- Import icons: import { Plus, Check } from "lucide-react"
- Path alias: @/ maps to src/
- Use sonner for toasts: import { toast } from "sonner"; toast("Done!")
- For forms: use react-hook-form with zodResolver
- For conditional classes: import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"; cn("base-class", condition && "extra-class")
- Customize components by adding variants, NOT inline overrides

FEATURE COMPLETENESS:
- For lists: ALWAYS include filters/tabs, item count badge, and empty state message
- For forms: ALWAYS include validation (zod) and success/error feedback (sonner toast)
- For dashboards: ALWAYS include stat cards, charts, and activity feeds
- For all apps: responsive layout, hover/focus states, loading skeletons

COMMANDS — you have full shell access and MUST use it:
- Run `npm install && npm run dev` to install and start the dev server
- You CAN and SHOULD run any shell commands needed
- NEVER use `vite` directly — always use `npm run dev`
- To add more shadcn components: npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
